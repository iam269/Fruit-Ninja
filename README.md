# 🍉 Fruit Ninja (Unity)

**Fruit Ninja** is an action-packed arcade game inspired by the original mobile hit developed by **Halfbrick Studios** and released in April 2010.  
In this game, the player uses fast and precise swipe motions to slice fruits as they are thrown into the air, aiming to score as many points as possible while avoiding dangerous objects.

This Unity project recreates the core gameplay mechanics of Fruit Ninja, focusing on realistic physics, satisfying visual feedback, and smooth interactions.
